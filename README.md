## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
This command-line application accepts input from the user when prompted for information about their application repository. A high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of the project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.

When the project title is entered into the command-line after the prompt, the title is displayed as the title of the README. When the user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests.

A list of three license options populates for the user to select and the badge for that license is added under the title. A notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that states which license the application is covered under.

The user is prompted for their GitHub user name and the link is populated within the README, followed by a prompt for the user's email address.

When the user clicks on the links in the Table of Contents, they are taken to the corresponding section of the README.
